# Project2
IS2043 project by Andrew Mares yxi042
Here are notes I took when working through the project the first time around on 10/3/2020

in "What is bash" my echo $SHELL  shows src/bin/bash

cal command not working

in "File names and permissions " is skipped no file named hello-world.sh yet

skipped "Relative and Absolute path" not same directory as mine

man ls doesnt give mannual in git bash

in "variables" when creating backup /home/andrew doesn't exist

the heck is the touch command

touched foobar, then ls -1 foobar, didn't get same result

I misspelled stdoutandderr.txt to stdoutanddeer.txt

in "Functions" backup could not find the path

in "Conditional Statements" same issue in backup.sh where there is no file path

using the backup.sh from the "Untill Loop" does not produce anything but a blank line, however the backup.sh from the "Positional Parameters" which I have named backup1.sh, does produce text but does not work as inttended because there is no file path

learned that I can add -A to git add to add all the files to the git

Github didn't like the use of LF and replaced it with CRLF in the .sh files however
